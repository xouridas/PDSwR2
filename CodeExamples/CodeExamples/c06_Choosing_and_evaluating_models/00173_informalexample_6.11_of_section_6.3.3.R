## "Forget depth of meaning, leave your logic at the door, and have a great time with this 
## maniacally funny, totally absurdist, ultra-campy live-action \"cartoon\". 
## MYSTERY MEN is a send-up of every superhero flick you've ever seen, but its unlikely 
## super-wannabes are so interesting, varied, and well-cast that they are memorable characters 
## in their own right. Dark humor, downright silliness, bona fide action, and even a touching 
## moment or two, combine to make this comic fantasy about lovable losers a true winner. 
## The comedic talents of the actors playing the Mystery Men -- including one Mystery Woman -- 
## are a perfect foil for Wes Studi as what can only be described as a bargain-basement Yoda, 
## and Geoffrey Rush as one of the most off-the-wall (and bizarrely charming) villains ever to 
## walk off the pages of a Dark Horse comic book and onto the big screen. Get ready to laugh, 
## cheer, and say \"huh?\" more than once.... enjoy!"
