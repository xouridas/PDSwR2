## "Jameson Parker And Marilyn Hassett are the screen's most unbelievable couple since John 
## Travolta and Lily Tomlin. Larry Peerce's direction wavers uncontrollably between black farce 
## and Roman tragedy. Robert Klein certainly think it's the former and his self-centered 
## performance in a minor role underscores the total lack of balance and chemistry between the 
## players in the film. Normally, I don't like to let myself get so ascerbic, but The Bell Jar 
## is one of my all-time favorite books, and to watch what they did with it makes me literally 
## crazy."
