# Note 1: 
#   A function to calculate y * log(py), with the convention that 0 * log(0) = 0. 

# Note 2: 
#   Get the class labels of the test set as TRUE/FALSE, which R treats as 1/0 in arithmetic operations. 

# Note 3: 
#   Calculate the log likelihood of the modelâ€™s predictions on the test set.
