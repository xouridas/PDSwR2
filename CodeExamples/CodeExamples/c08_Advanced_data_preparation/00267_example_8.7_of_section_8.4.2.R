# Warning message:
# glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred

# Note 1: 
#   Build a formula specifying modeling churn == 1 as a function of all variables. 

# Note 2: 
#   Use the modeling formula with Râ€™s glm() function. 

# Note 3: 
#   Take heed of this warning: it is hinting we should move on to a regularized method such as 
#   glmnet.
