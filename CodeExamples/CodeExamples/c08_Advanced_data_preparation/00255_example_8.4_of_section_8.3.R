# Note 1: 
#   Attach the vtreat package for functions such as designTreatmentsC(). 

# Note 2: 
#   Start up a parallel cluster to speed up 
#   calculation. If you donâ€™t want a parallel cluster, just set 
#   parallel_cluster to NULL. 

# Note 3: 
#   Use designTreatmentsC() to learn the treatment plan from the training data. For a dataset of the size and complexity of KDD2009, this can take a few minutes.
