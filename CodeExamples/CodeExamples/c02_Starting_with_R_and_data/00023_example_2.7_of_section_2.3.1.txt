First in a `bash` shell perform the following steps:

wget https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/pums/2016/1-Year/csv_hus.zip    	# Note: 3 
md5 csv_hus.zip
# MD5 (csv_hus.zip) = c81d4b96a95d573c1b10fc7f230d5f7a                                 	# Note: 4 
wget https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/pums/2016/1-Year/csv_pus.zip
md5 csv_pus.zip
# MD5 (csv_pus.zip) = 06142320c3865620b0630d74d74181db
wget http://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/tech_docs/pums/data_dict/PUMSDataDict16.txt

# Note 1: 
#   When we downloaded the data. 

# Note 2: 
#   Where we found the data documentation. 
#   This is important to record, as many data files 
#   donâ€™t contain links back to the 
#   documentation. 

# Note 3: 
#   The exact steps we took. 

# Note 4: 
#   Cryptographic hashes of the file 
#   contents we downloaded. These are very short 
#   summaries (called hashes) that are highly unlikely 
#   to have the same value for different files. These 
#   summaries can later help us determine if another 
#   researcher in our organization is using the same 
#   data.
