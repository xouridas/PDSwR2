# Note 1: 
#   If you have downloaded the PDSwR2 code example directory, then the household dataset is in the 
#   directory PDSwR2/Custdata. Here we assume that this is your working directory. 

# Note 2: 
#   Get the unique household IDs. 

# Note 3: 
#   Generate a unique sampling group ID per 
#   household, and put in a column named gp. 

# Note 4: 
#   Join the household IDs back into the original 
#   data.
